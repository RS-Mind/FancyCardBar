# Fancy Card Bar
Allows mod developers to add custom icons to the card bar.

## Usage:
1. Use the included template to create an icon for your card.
2. Add the "Fancy Icon" script to your card in unity
3. Drag the icon's prefab onto the script
4. Include the "DummyFancyCardBar.dll" in your mod's .zip to prevent console errors when this mod is not installed. (Alternatively, instead include this mod as a dependency)
